# Tonkintelligent: An Intelligent Legacy Retrieval System for Tonkin

Tonkin has decades of valuable legacy project data, much of it is siloed, unstructured, and difficult to access. Retrieval often depends on individual memory or internal networks, making knowledge reuse inefficient.

**Tonkintelligent** is an intelligent retrieval system designed to unlock this legacy data. By embedding project documents into a searchable knowledge base, it enables fast, accurate, and reliable information retrieval for all Tonkin stuff.
